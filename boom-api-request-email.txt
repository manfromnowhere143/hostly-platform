Subject: API Access Request - Rently (Reservations Data + Webhooks)

Hi Boom Team,

I'm Daniel from Rently - we manage 29 vacation rental properties in Eilat and have been using Boom as our channel manager.

We're building our own property management dashboard (moving away from Simple Booking) and need to pull reservation data from Boom. Our API credentials are working for listings, but the /reservations endpoint returns empty (204).

**Our API credentials:**
- Client ID: boom_a4a21558679b67f56789
- Account: Rently (rently.co.il)

**What we need:**

1. **Historical Reservation Data** - Access to all past bookings (guest name, check-in/out dates, revenue, payout, source channel like Airbnb/Booking.com/Direct)

2. **Webhook Setup** - Can you configure webhooks to push new reservations to our endpoint? This way we'll receive real-time booking notifications going forward.
   - Our webhook URL: https://api.hostly.io/webhooks/boom (or we can provide any URL you need)

3. **Calendar/Availability Access** - Currently getting 406 on /listings/{id}/calendar and /availability endpoints

We're getting these responses:
- GET /reservations → 204 (empty)
- GET /listings/{id}/calendar → 406
- GET /listings/{id}/availability → 406

Is there a different API tier or permission level needed for reservation data? Simple Booking currently has access to our reservations through Boom - we need the same access for our new system.

Happy to jump on a quick call if that's easier to sort out.

Thanks!
Daniel
